# *Coffee with Laravel* Project

Welcome to the project we are developing throughout the videos on the **Coffee with Laravel** channel! â˜•ðŸš€

This project is a hands-on initiative to teach and demonstrate Laravel's use in everyday development. In our videos, we have already developed several essential features for modern systems, including:

- **Permissions and Roles (ACL)**: User management and access control.  
- **Create Modal**: A sleek modal for creating records.  
- **Edit Modal**: An interface for editing records directly in the system.  
- **Delete Modal**: A secure confirmation for deleting records.  
- **Logout Modal**: An improved user logout experience.

And this is just the beginning! ðŸš§ We are constantly bringing new content and features to enrich your Laravel development journey.

Follow our videos to learn each step of this project and much more. Join us on this journey of learning and growth in Laravel development!
